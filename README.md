# Wabbajack-Skip
Simple tool for automatically pressing the "SLOW DOWNLOAD" button on Nexus Mods while using [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack).
This isn't an alternative to [nexus premium](https://users.nexusmods.com/account/billing/premium). This is not a perfect solution and you will still be limited by download speed.
# To Run
Simply go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Xavlume/WabbajackSkip/releases/tag/Initial) and download WabbajackSkip.zip.
Extract the contents and run main.exe. An empty console window should pop-up, indicating that it's running.

You could also download the source code and run **python main.py** if you have python installed.

Finally run Wabbajack and sit back while WabbajackSkip clicks Away!
# Settings
To edit the built-in delay between tries and successful clicks, edit the **settings.ini** file next to main.py or main.exe.
